### Jobs

Fill the `jobs.json` with your cronjobs.

For the above crontab example the `jobs.json` should look like this:

```json
[
  "testjob": {
    "cron": "* * * * *",
    "grace_time": "60"
  }
]
```

> Note: The `grace_time` is the time in seconds the job is allowed to run. If the job runs longer than the `grace_time` it will be marked as failed.

## TODO

## Delete Jobs

The jobs are stored in the database.
So it is not enough to delete the job from the `jobs.json`.

Steps:

- Delete the job from the `jobs.json`
- Restart the server
- Run the `runner/delete_job.sh` script

```bash
./runner/delete_job.sh # You will receive a list of all jobs and can select the job you want to delete.
```

### Delete a job - Example

Remove the job `testjob` from the `jobs.json`.

```bash
nano jobs.json
# Remove the job "testjob"
```

Restart the server

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

Wait a few seconds and run the `runner/delete_job.sh` script.

```bash
./runner/delete_job.sh
```

Enter the job id you want to delete and press enter.

Example output:

```bash
cronitor_selfhost git:(main) âœ— ./runner/delete_job.sh
Disabled jobs:

testjob

Enter job id to delete: testjob
{"message":"Job deleted"}
```
