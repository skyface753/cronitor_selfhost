# Conitor Self-Hosted

Cronitor is a monitoring platform for your cron jobs, background tasks and scheduled scripts.

This Repository is a self-developed, self-hosted version of Cronitor by [Skyface](https://skyface.de).

## Installation

### Runner

Make the `scripts/runner.sh` executable

```bash
chmod +x scripts/runner.sh
```

### Config

Edit the `scripts/config.sh` file and set the `API_ENDPOINT` and `API_KEY` (same as in the following `.env` file).

### Jobs

The server needs a `jobs.json` file to know which jobs to run.

> **NAMES** must be unique and can only contain letters, numbers and underscores (No spaces are allowed).

> **GRACE TIME** is in seconds. If the job runs longer than the grace time, it will be marked as failed.

#### Automatically

Use the `scripts/job_generator.sh` script to generate the `jobs.json` file.

It will read your crontabs and asks you for a name and grace time for each job.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/job_generator.sh
./scripts/job_generator.sh
```

#### Manually

Fill the `jobs.json` with your cronjobs.

An example with the job id (name) `testjob`, a cron expression of `* * * * *` and a grace time of `60` seconds.

```json
[
  "testjob": {
    "cron": "* * * * *",
    "grace_time": "60"
  }
]
```

### Crontab

Wrap all your crontab commands with the `scripts/runner.sh` script

So instead of

```bash
* * * * * echo "hello world"
```

use

```bash
crontab -e

# Example
# <cron_expression> <path_to_runner.sh> <job_id> <command>
* * * * * /home/user/cronitor_selfhost/scripts/runner.sh testjob echo "hello world"
```

### Environment variables

Copy and edit the `.env.example` file to `.env` and adjust the variables to your needs.

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

## Delete Jobs

The jobs are stored in the database.
So it is not enough to delete the job from the `jobs.json`.

Steps:

- Delete the job from the `jobs.json`
- Restart the server
- Run the `scripts/delete_job.sh` script

```bash
./scripts/delete_job.sh # You will receive a list of all jobs and can select the job you want to delete.
```

### Delete a job - Example

Remove the job `testjob` from the `jobs.json`.

```bash
nano jobs.json
# Remove the job "testjob"
```

Restart the server

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

Wait a few seconds and run the `scripts/delete_job.sh` script.

```bash
./scripts/delete_job.sh
```

Enter the job id you want to delete and press enter.

Example output:

```bash
cronitor_selfhost git:(main) âœ— ./scripts/delete_job.sh
Disabled jobs:

testjob

Enter job id to delete: testjob
{"message":"Job deleted"}
```

## Logs

The error logs are also stored in the folder `logs`.
The folder will be created automatically, when the first error occurs.

## Development

### Prisma

Create a Migration. Change the `--name`.

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/test_db" prisma migrate dev --name added_enums_for_stati --schema ./server/prisma/schema.prisma
```

Deploy the Migration

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/test_db" prisma migrate deploy --schema ./server/prisma/schema.prisma
```
